    <h1>Support International Flights at Norfolk International Airport</h1>
    <p>
        Below is a formal letter addressed to Senator Mark Warner urging support for international flights at Norfolk International Airport (ORF). 
        Fill out the form below to personalize the letter.

The Honorable Mark Warner  
Senator for Virginia  
703 Hart Senate Office Building  
Washington, D.C. 20510  

Dear Senator Warner,  

I am writing to you as a resident of [City/Region] and a constituent who cares deeply about the growth and accessibility of our region. 
I urge you to support the expansion of Norfolk International Airport (ORF) to include international flights.  

Recently, a report highlighted that ORF has significant demand for international destinations, with the potential to fill multiple flights a 
week to Europe (source: WAVY News). Expanding ORF’s capabilities to host international flights would bring substantial economic, cultural, 
and tourism benefits to our region and strengthen its global connections.  

Currently, many residents and businesses in Hampton Roads must travel long distances to access international flights. Offering direct 
international connections from ORF would save time, reduce costs, and enhance the region’s appeal as a hub for commerce, military operations, and tourism.  

Federal support is vital in making this vision a reality. Your influence could help Norfolk International Airport secure funding and 
resources needed for infrastructure improvements, attracting airlines, and meeting federal and international aviation standards.  

As our senator, your advocacy for this initiative would reflect your commitment to the economic growth and well-being of Virginians. 
I kindly ask that you champion this effort and help make international flights at ORF a priority.  

Thank you for considering this request. I am hopeful for your support in this endeavor, and I am happy to provide any further information 
or assistance needed to advance this cause.  

Sincerely,  
[Your Full Name]  
[Your Address]
